# ShaderHelper

A small helper thrown together over the course of a couple days. Shaders are automatically loaded from other mods, and are expected to be in the compiled shader object (cso) format. These can be made using a tool like [EFB](http://github.com/GlaireDaggers/Effect-Build) (thanks jade for finding this tool and generally helping).
